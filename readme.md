# FYP-1-Steamlit-demo-app

This repository contains the second part of my Final Year Project, which is the front-end application for displaying the results of the Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) done on Shopee reviews.

This part of the project uses Streamlit for creating the web application and it is mainly written in Jupyter Notebook and Python.

The main file in this repository is main.py, which contains the Streamlit application.

Below are the links for the staging and production version of the application.
